# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
Predict employee salaries using Linear Regression with preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and visualization.

## Project Overview
This project predicts employee salary using machine learning regression techniques. It demonstrates the complete data science workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.



##  Objective
To estimate employee salary based on experience, education, and job role.



## Dataset Features
- Age  
- Gender  
- Education Level  
- Job Title  
- Years of Experience  

Target Variable: **Salary**



## Workflow

1. Data Loading  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
3. Missing Value Handling  
4. Duplicate Check
5. Data Type Optimization 
6. Data Visualization  
7. Encoding  
8. Train-Test Split  
9. Feature Scaling  
10. Model Training  
11. Evaluation  
12. Prediction Visualization  



## Model Used
**Linear Regression**

Chosen because salary shows a strong linear relationship with experience.



## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| R² Score | Measures model fit |
| MSE | Penalizes large errors |
| MAE | Average prediction error |

## Results

| Model | R² Score |
|-------|--------|
| Linear Regression | **0.85** |

## Visualizations Included
- Salary distribution histogram  
- Experience vs Salary scatter plot  
- Actual vs Predicted salary plot  



## Key Insights
- Salary increases with experience.
- Education level contributes to salary variation.
- Linear Regression performed effectively on structured data.



## Skills Demonstrated
✔ Data Cleaning  
✔ Missing Value Handling  
✔ Encoding  
✔ Feature Scaling  
✔ Regression Modeling  
✔ Evaluation Metrics  
✔ Data Visualization  

## Conclusion
The model successfully captures the relationship between experience and salary, achieving **85% variance explanation**, making it a strong predictive system.

The model shows that years of experience and education level strongly influence salary.
